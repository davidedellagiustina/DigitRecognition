# Handwritten digits recognition

In this repository I uploaded all the software I developed for my High School thesis project.

It features a Feed-Forward Neural Network backend bundled with a simple GUI which allows the user to draw a digit inside a canvas (using touchscreen, a graphic tablet or even a mouse) and that then shows all the processing stages which are done on the image in order to recognize the digit that it's written in it.

The Feed-Forward NN was trained over the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). Various trained neural networks are provided inside the res/neural_network folder, even if the program uses the one which scored the best results on the MNIST test dataset (97.02%).
